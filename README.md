## About

The main goal of this project was to implement a portfolio website using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) with BEM methodology as well as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. The generated website provides information about me and my recent projects.

The project runs online here: [filipciesielski7.github.io/Portfolio/](https://filipciesielski7.github.io/Portfolio/)
